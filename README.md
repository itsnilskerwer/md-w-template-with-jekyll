# GH Pages Site (Minimal Jekyll)
Website template for a Markdown-based docs site hosted on GH Pages

## About

This project is built around using markdown content to make a website. 

This is great for non-developers to work on. No experience with Ruby, Jekyll, Liquid, HTML or CSS required. Those are all used internally, but no need to worry about that.

This repo is super light. No config needed. You don't need to setup a theme or a layout. GitHub will figure that out and will apply its standard theme to your GitHub Pages site. So will it will have a clean, white, mobile-friendly site with a heading.

The page you are currently viewing is `README.md`.
